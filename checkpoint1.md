## Checkpoint 1: Public Response to Residential Schools Apology in 2008

Primary Data: The data I intend to explore is Twitter posts from June of 2008 when Stephen Harper made his apology regarding Indian Residential Schools. As well, Google Analytics and Adwords data regarding searches for topics related to the residential schools will be analyzed. Additionally, I want to take a look at usage statistics for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) website to see if there are any trends in visitation. 

Collection method: twarc will be used to gather tweets spanning several weeks, searching for terms and hashtags such as indians, first nations, aboriginal, etc., while I will download spreadsheets of Google data that will be fixed up using Google Refine. 

Repository structure: My repository to be used can be found [here](https://github.com/ryanpickering/Residential-School-Online-Response). It is going to be structured to hold all of my separate tweets in one part, all of my spreadsheet data from Google Analytics and Adwords in another part, and spreadsheets of the information with varying design styles for analysis in another area. 

Secondary Readings: Some readings that I am excited to shape my work with can be found [here](https://github.com/ryanpickering/research-notebook-hist3907b/blob/master/_xbibliography.txt). All 3 of these deal with public history around the Residential Schools legacy and the public's response. While they may not deal with any online segment exactly, I think my work will be able to fit within their discourse quite nicely. 

Initial thoughts on what you might find/explore/puzzle over

Alright, so I am very excited to start working on this project. I'm not exactly sure what I'll find when I delve into the data, and I'm scared that tweets about residential schools will be from activists mainly, which is not what I am initially hoping for: I was looking for a cross-section of Canadians to see trends in location, age, etc. However, seeing activist and Indigenous activity online at this time would be interesting too, and stats relating to that would also be something interesting to discuss. Perhaps I could shape some of my visualization to show either activist or non-activist activity on Twitter at this time?

Another thing I'm looking forward to finding out... are there any noticeable trends in location of looking up/talking about this stuff? What websites are being explored for information, and what are THEY saying? Who is going to the TRC website nowadays, and has that amount gone up or down with events like Idle No More, protests against fracking in the east, or one of the Omnibus bills? All of this stuff and more is going to be really cool to explore in the next couple of weeks. I need to start working on twarc soon though to figure out how to do this well!
